#### THIS IS ONLY FOR GOOD INTENTION, IF YOU VIOLATE THIS, CONSEQUENCES IS ALL YOURS.

#### Using VPN (Easy)

- Use [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) since this free, unlimited and safe to use but slower. Can used without account on Android, but need to use Play Store Version

[Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.protonvpn.android)

#### Using DPI Bypass Software, and Encrypted DNS (Harder but faster)
WARN: before applying this, use Encrypted DNS First!
